*NOTE: This project is part of **Sprint 4 of Module 3** in the Data Analytics program at **Turing College**.*

## Project Overview üîç

### Goal
A fast-food chain conducted an **A/B test** to evaluate three different **marketing campaigns** and determine which one **maximizes weekly sales**.

## Dataset source üóÉÔ∏è
The data used in this A/B testing analysis comes from the [Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test) dataset on Kaggle.  
It contains weekly sales performance data from the target **fast food locations** running one of the new **marketing campaigns** for 4 weeks.

### Columns from the original table:
| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| *MarketID* | unique identifier for market |
| *MarketSize* | size of market area by sales |
| *LocationID* | unique identifier for store location |
| *AgeOfStore* | age of store in years |
| *Promotion* | one of three promotions that were tested |
| *week* | one of four weeks when the promotions were run |
| *SalesInThousands* | sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and week |

## Methodology
*(Step 1)* **Data aggregation on SQL** ‚Üí count of location for each promotion, mean and standard deviation of their average weekly sales.  
*(Step 2)* **Statistical test thourgh pairwise comparison** ‚Üí Two-Sample T-Test *(Œ± = 0.01)* to compare sales performance.

### Hypothesis
  - *H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis)* ‚Üí No difference between promotions.  
  - *H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis)* ‚Üí At least one promotion performs better.

## Key results üí°
Promotion 1 significantly outperformed Promotion 2 *(p-value < 0.01)*.  
At the same time, there is no significant difference between Promotion 1 & 3 and Promotion 2 & 3 *(p-values > 0.01)*.  

### Business recommendations
- Prioritize Promotion 1 as the most effective campaign.  
- Further test Promotion 3, as it performed similarly to Promotion 1.  
- Discontinue Promotion 2, as it showed the weakest impact.
