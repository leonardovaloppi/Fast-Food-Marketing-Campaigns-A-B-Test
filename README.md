# Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test

*NOTE: This project is part of **Sprint 4 of Module 3** in the Data Analytics program at **Turing College**. It focuses on analyzing an **A/B test** to evaluate the performance of different **fast food marketing campaigns** and provide **data-driven recommendations**.*

## Project Overview üîç

### Goal
A fast-food chain conducted an **A/B test** to evaluate three different **marketing campaigns** and determine which one **maximizes weekly sales**.

## Dataset source üìÇ

The data used in this A/B testing analysis comes from the **Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test** dataset on Kaggle.  
It contains sales performance data from different **fast food locations** running **three marketing campaigns**.

### Columns from the original table:
| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| *MarketID* | unique identifier for market |
| *MarketSize* | size of market area by sales |
| *LocationID* | unique identifier for store location |
| *AgeOfStore* | age of store in years |
| *Promotion* | one of three promotions that were tested |
| *week* | one of four weeks when the promotions were run |
| *SalesInThousands* | sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and week |

### Methodology
- **Data Aggregation**: Sales data grouped by `LocationID`, `PromotionID`.  
- **Statistical Test**: Two-Sample T-Test *(Œ± = 0.01)* to compare sales performance.  
- **Hypothesis**:
  - *H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):* No difference between promotions.  
  - *H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):* At least one promotion performs better.

### **Key Results**
Promotion 1 significantly outperformed Promotion 2 *(p-value < 0.01)*.  
At the same time, there is no significant difference between Promotion 1 & 3 and Promotion 2 & 3 *(p-values > 0.01)*.  

### **Business Recommendations** üéØ
- Prioritize Promotion 1 as the most effective campaign.  
- Further test Promotion 3, as it performed similarly to Promotion 1.  
- Discontinue Promotion 2, as it showed the weakest impact.
